      "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between two great mountains, there lived an old woodcarver named Kaito. He was known throughout the village for his incredible skill and attention to detail, which allowed him to bring even the most delicate of creatures to life.\n",
      "\n",
      "One day, a young girl named Akira wandered into Kaito's workshop, her eyes wide with wonder as she took in the array of half-finished sculptures and half-carved logs that lined the walls. She had heard stories about the old man's magic, how he could shape wood into anything his heart desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "Akira approached Kaito, who was sitting in a worn armchair by the fire, his eyes fixed on a small wooden bird that sat on his lap. \"Master Kaito,\" she said, her voice barely above a whisper, \"I've heard you can create magic with wood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaito looked up at Akira, a hint of a smile on his face. \"Ah, yes,\" he said. \"Wood is a powerful tool. With the right touch and the heart of the craftsman, it can become anything.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Without warning, Kaito reached out and took Akira's hand in his. He led her to a blank piece of wood that sat on a nearby workbench, its surface smooth and unblemished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Close your eyes,\" he said, his voice low and soothing. \"Feel the wood beneath your fingers. Imagine what you would like it to become.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Akira did as she was told, feeling the wood's rough texture beneath her skin. As she breathed in deeply, a vision began to take shape in her mind – a great eagle soaring through the skies, its wings outstretched and its feathers glistening in the sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Akira opened her eyes, Kaito was smiling at her. \"The wood is willing,\" he said. \"Now, let us see what magic we can create together.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And with that, Kaito began to carve the wood, his hands moving swiftly and surely as the eagle began to take shape before their very eyes. As they worked, Akira felt a strange energy building inside her – an energy that seemed to pulse through every molecule of the wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "When at last they finished, Akira gasped in wonder as she beheld the magnificent creature standing on the workbench before her. Its wings were spread wide, and its feathers shone like gold in the firelight. The eagle let out a soft hoot, as if it had come alive under their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "As they stood there, frozen in awe, Kaito leaned forward and whispered to Akira, \"Magic is not just something you find outside – it's also within. Sometimes, all it takes is a little bit of imagination and the right tools to bring it into being.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day on, Akira spent every spare moment with Kaito in his workshop, learning the secrets of woodcarving and magic from the wise old craftsman. And as she worked alongside him, she discovered that the boundaries between reality and fantasy were far more blurred than she had ever imagined."

      "**Components**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Client-Side Implementation**: The `client` folder contains the API client for interacting with DungBeetle's SQL Jobber API. The `client.go` file provides an API client for creating, updating, and deleting jobs, as well as fetching their status and statuses for groups.\n",
      "2. **SQL Database Schema**: The `sql` folder contains SQL files for various database projects, including PostgreSQL and MySQL. These files support profit calculations, data retrieval, and slow query simulation.\n",
      "3. **Queue-Based Concurrency Mechanism**: The system utilizes a queue-based concurrency mechanism to manage parallel processing and prevent unexpected changes to concurrency levels.\n",
      "4. **Job Execution Framework**: The system provides a framework for executing jobs concurrently with specified concurrency levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Functionality**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Profit Calculations**: The system supports profit calculations, including fetching data from the database, performing calculations, and returning results to the user.\n",
      "2. **Slow Query Simulation**: The system allows for slow query simulation using `pg_sleep($1)`, which can be used to demonstrate delayed processing with a sleep function.\n",
      "3. **Concurrency Management**: The system manages concurrency levels to prevent unexpected changes and ensures that jobs are executed in a timely manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Testing**\n",
      "\n",
      "The project includes comprehensive tests for the client module's job management functionality, including job submission, group submission, status checking, and error handling. Additionally, there are test files (`test.sql.sample`, `test.postgres.sql`, and `test.mysql.sql`) that demonstrate various database queries and concurrency levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Languages and Frameworks**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Go**: The client-side implementation is written in Go.\n",
      "2. **SQL**: The SQL database schema is implemented using PostgreSQL and MySQL.\n",
      "3. **Concurrency**: The system utilizes a queue-based concurrency mechanism, which is likely implemented using a message broker or similar technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the project appears to be a robust and scalable system for managing profit calculations and slow query simulation in various databases.\n"
